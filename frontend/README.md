# WikiFamily Project

Our project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What you can do

### Git clone this repo

### Make changes

Don't edit index.js file, there's nothing to change there.\
Use files in `pages` folder to change website's pages.\
Use files in `components` folder to change the elements of website's pages.\
Use files in `style` folder to change css files.

### Use `npm start` command to run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`(don't do that yet)

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
